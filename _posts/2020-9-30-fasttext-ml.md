### Word Embeddings

- For processing natural language & extracting useful info from that text using ML, requires that this text should be understandable by machine. For this purpose, the text is converted into set of real numbers, technically a vector.

- WE is basically a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation in the vector space.

- The process of converting words into real numbers/vectors -> Vectorization.


- Word embeddings help in the following use cases.
  - Compute similar words
  - Calculate semantics behind words
  - Document clustering/grouping
  - Feature extraction for text classifications
  - Natural language processing.


- Word embeddings can be calculated using pre-trained methods from libraries such as,
  - Word2Vec — From Google
  - fastText — From Facebook
  - GloVe — From Stanford


- These are distributed representations of text in an n-dimensional space. Essential for solving most NLP problems.

- These vectors capture hidden information about a language, like word analogies or semantics.


### Word Embedding Methods

These methods learn a real-valued vector representation for a predefined fixed sized vocabulary from a corpus of text.

Most famous architectures such as Word2Vec, Fasttext, Glove converts text to word vectors and uses the cosine similarity between these WE in this n-dimensional vector space for calculating word similarity features.

- <ins>**Embedding layer**</ins>
    - Most native approach

    - Here word embeddings are learned jointly with a neural network model on a specific natural language processing task.

    - The embedding layer is used on the front end of a neural network and is fit in a supervised way using the Backpropagation algorithm.

    - This approach of learning an embedding layer requires a lot of training data and is slow.

    - 2 methods:
      - FeedForward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)
      - Recurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)

    - NNLM, RNNLM outperforms for the huge dataset of words but computation complexity is a big overhead

- <ins>**Word2Vec**</ins>
    - Developed at Google

    - Word representations in Vector Space, or word2vec algorithm.

    - Makes the neural-network-based training of the embedding more efficient and is now the de-facto standard for developing pre-trained word embedding.

    - Takes a large text corpus as I/P and produces a vector space, of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in this space.

    - Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another.

    - 2 learning models were introduced for learning the word embedding:
      - <ins>Continuous Bag-of-Words, or CBOW model:</ins>
      learns the embedding by predicting the current word based on its context.

      - <ins>Continuous Skip-gram Model:</ins>
      learns the embedding by predicting the surrounding words given a current word.

      ![](../assets/images/FT-2.png)

    - Key benefit is that high-quality word embeddings can be learned efficiently (low space and time complexity), allowing larger embeddings to be learned (more dimensions) from much larger corpora of text (billions of words).


- <ins>**GloVe**</ins>
    - Developed at Stanford.

    - Global Vectors for Word Representation, or GloVe, algorithm is an extension to the Word2Vec method for efficiently learning word vectors.

    - an approach to combine both the global statistics of matrix factorization techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) with the local context-based learning in Word2Vec.

    - Rather than using a window to define local context, GloVe constructs an explicit word-context or word co-occurrence matrix using statistics across the whole text corpus. The result is a learning model that may result in generally better word embeddings.

### FastText

We can either generate word vectors for any raw data or use the pre-trained word vectors which ship with FastText.

<ins>**Example**</ins>

`Downloading & cleaning raw dataset`
```bash
jalaz@jalaz-personal:~ wget -c http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip -P data/
jalaz@jalaz-personal:~ unzip data/enwik9.zip -d data/
jalaz@jalaz-personal:~ perl /home/jalaz/fastText/wikifil.pl data/enwik9 > data/fil9
```

`Generation of word vectors`
```python
import fasttext

# Generation by default settings
model = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9')

# Saving the model for later use
model.save_model("result/fil9.bin")
model = fasttext.load_model("result/fil9.bin")
```

2 models for computing word representations:
  1. **skipgram model** learns to predict a target word thanks to a nearby word.
  2. **cbow model** predicts the target word according to its context. The context is represented as a bag of the words contained in a fixed size window around the target word.

  ![cbow-skipgram](../assets/images/FT-3.png)

Practcally, skipgram models works better with subword information than cbow models.

`Tweaking parameters`
```python
model1 = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9_small', model="cbow")
model2 = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9_small', model="skipgram")
model3 = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9', minn=2, maxn=5, dim=300)
model4 = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9', epoch=1, lr=0.5)
model5 = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9', thread=4)
```

- **dim** (dimension)
  - Controls the size of the vectors
  - larger dim -> more information capture but requires more data to be learned.
  - If too large -> harder and slower to train.
  - By default, dim = 100, but any value in the 100-300 range is good.


- **subwords**
  - All the substrings contained in a word between **minn** and **maxn**.
  - By default, subword = (3, 6). For different languages ranges may vary.


- **epoch**
  - Controls how many times the model will loop over the dataset for training.
  - By default, epoch = 5. For massive dataset, epoch should be less.


- **lr**
  - Higher lr -> faster the model converge to a solution but at the risk of overfitting to the dataset.
  - By default, lr = 0.05

- **thread**
  - fastText is multi-threaded and uses 12 threads by default.
  - This can easily be tweaked using this parameter for CPUs having less cores.

`Usage of word embeddings`

- Word embedding generated for a word can be checked

  `Script`
  ```python
  print(model.words)
  print("\n-------------------------------------\n")
  print(model.get_word_vector("female"))
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  ['the',
   'of',
   ...
   'germany',
   ...
   'actress',
   ...
   'governor',
   'players',
   ...
   'models',
   ...]
   -------------------------------------
  [ 0.01122757  0.18961109 -0.16199729  0.11208588
   ---      ---     ---     ---     ---     ---     ---
    0.19992262 -0.06550902 -0.40920728 -0.16724268]
  ```


- Semantic information of the vectors are captured with the **nn functionality**.

  `Script`
  ```python
  model.get_nearest_neighbors('london')
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  [(0.7785311341285706, 'princeton'),
   (0.7696226239204407, 'cambridge'),
   (0.7583264112472534, 'glasgow'),
   (0.7519310116767883, 'oxfordshire'),
   ...,
   (0.7124481797218323, 'routledge')]
  ```


- **nn functionality** can also be used for spellcorrections purposes.

  `Script`
  ```python
  model.get_nearest_neighbors('actres')
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  [(0.9361368417739868, 'actress'),
   (0.9093650579452515, 'actresses'),
   (0.852777361869812, 'actor'),
   (0.8409433364868164, 'songwriter'),
   ...,
   (0.771904468536377, 'snooker')]
  ```


- **analogies functionality** can be used for managing & finding hidden analogies between the data points.

  `Script`
  ```python
  model.get_analogies("berlin", "germany", "france")
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  [(0.896462, u'paris'),
   (0.768954, u'bourges'),
   ...,
   (0.740635, u'bordeaux'),
   (0.736122, u'pigneaux')]
  ```


- **character n-grams** are really important. Using subword-level information helps building the vectors in the vector-space for totally unknown words.

  `Script`
  ```python
  model_without_subwords = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9_small', maxn=0)
  model_normal = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data/fil9_small')
  model_without_subwords.get_nearest_neighbors('accomodation')
  print("\n------------------------------------\n")
  model_normal.get_nearest_neighbors('accomodation')
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  [(0.775057, u'sunnhordland'),
   (0.769206, u'accomodations'),
   (0.753011, u'administrational'),
   ...,
   (0.732465, u'asserbo')]
   ------------------------------------
  [(0.96342, u'accomodations'),
   (0.942124, u'accommodation'),
   (0.915427, u'accommodations'),
   ...,
   (0.701426, u'hospitality')]
  ```

## Text Classification

Text classification is ML problem for classifying any text into 1 or more labels after training the model using supervised learning methods.

  - Spam detection, language identification, sentiment analysis comes under this domain.

  - Can be single-label classifiers (like spam identifier: spam-not spam) or multi-label classifiers (like language detector: hindi-english-telugu-tamil etc.)

  - For building such classifiers, labeled data is required, which consists of documents and their corresponding labels.

`Testing model accuarcy`

- <ins>**Precision**</ins>: Number of correct labels among the predicted labels.
- <ins>**Recall**</ins>: Number of real labels that could be predicted.

`Script`
```python
model.test("data/news-articles.valid")
model.test("data/news-articles.valid", k=5)
```

```bash
(40832, 0.5363685344827587, 0.5363685344827587)
(40832, 0.1458170062695925, 0.7290850313479624)
```

`Tweaking parameters & improvisations`

- **epochs & lr**

  - <ins>epoch</ins> denotes the number of iterations of training over each datapoint
  - <ins>lr</ins> denotes the learning rate.

    `Script`
    ```python
    modelv2 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", epoch=25)
    modelv2.test("data/news-articles.valid")
    modelv3 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", lr=1.0)
    modelv3.test("data/news-articles.valid")
    modelv4 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", epoch=25, lr=1.0)
    modelv4.test("data/news-articles.valid")
    ```
    `Output`
    ```bash
    (40832, 0.617701802507837, 0.617701802507837)
    (40832, 0.698226880877743, 0.698226880877743)
    (40832, 0.5116085423197492, 0.5116085423197492)
    ```

- **word n-grams**

  - <ins>word n-grams:</ins>
  Performance of model can be improved by using word bigrams, instead of just unigrams. Important for classification problems where word order is important like sentiment analysis.

  - <ins>unigram</ins> refers to a single undividing unit, or token. Can be a word or a letter depending on the model. In fastText, we work at the word level and thus unigrams are words.

  - <ins>bigram</ins> is the concatenation of 2 consecutive tokens or words.

  - "Last donut of the night"
    - unigrams: 'last', 'donut', 'of', 'the', 'night'.
    - bigrams: 'Last donut', 'donut of', 'of the', 'the night'.

  `Script`
  ```python
  modelv5 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", epoch=25, lr=1.0, wordNgrams=2)
  modelv5.test("data/news-articles.valid")
  modelv5.predict("narendra modi aquitted for gujarat riots by the court", k=-1, threshold=0.1)
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  (40832, 0.6719974529780565, 0.6719974529780565)
  (('__label__politics', '__label__crime', '__label__worldpost'), array([0.55176157, 0.24307342, 0.18037586]))
  ```

- **loss**
  - <ins>hs</ins> (scaling up for production)
    - training can be made faster for large dataset by using the hierarchical softmax, instead of the regular softmax
    - hierarchical softmax is a loss function that approximates the softmax with a much faster computation

  - <ins>ova</ins> (multi label classification)
    - for handling multiple labels, convenient way is to use independent binary classifiers for each label
    - one vs all loss helps achieve this.

  `Script`
  ```python
  modelv8 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", lr=1.0, epoch=25, wordNgrams=2, bucket=200000, dim=50, loss='hs')
  modelv8.test("data/news-articles.valid")

  modelv9 = fasttext.train_supervised(input="data/news-articles.train", lr=1.0, epoch=25, wordNgrams=2, bucket=200000, dim=50, loss='ova')
  modelv9.test("data/news-articles.valid")

  news = "justin beiber and selena gomez splits after 4 years of relationship"
  print(modelv8.predict(news, k=-1, threshold=0.1))
  print(modelv9.predict(news, k=-1, threshold=0.1))
  ```
  `Output`
  ```bash
  (40832, 0.6174568965517241, 0.6174568965517241)
  (40832, 0.655907131661442, 0.655907131661442)

  (('__label__entertainment',), array([0.99964833]))
  (('__label__entertainment',), array([0.95397609]))
  ```

`Autotuning the hyperparameters`
  - Finding best hyperparameters value is crucial for building efficient ml models.

  - Tuning these values manually is cumbersome since these parameters are dependent & their effects on final model vary from dataset to dataset.

  - fastText provides autotune feature for this task.

  ```python
  modelv10 = fasttext.train_supervised(input='data/news-articles.train', autotuneValidationFile='data/news-articles.valid')
  modelv11 = fasttext.train_supervised(input='data/news-articles.train', autotuneValidationFile='data/news-articles.valid', autotuneDuration=600)
  modelv12 = fasttext.train_supervised(input='data/news-articles.train', autotuneValidationFile='data/news-articles.valid', autotuneModelSize="2M")
  ```
