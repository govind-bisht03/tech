Spring Boot is an open-source micro framework maintained by a company called Pivotal. This is used to build `stand-alone`, `auto-configurable` and `production-ready` Spring Applications.

![Spring Boot](../assets/images/SB-1.png)

- Provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.

- It is basically a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework.

**Goals of Spring Boot:**

- Reduces development, unit testing, and integration testing time.
- Avoids defining more Annotation & XML Configuration.
- Avoids writing lots of import statements.

By achieving these, Spring Boot framework reduces development time, developer's effort, and increases productivity.

**Notable features of Spring Boot:**

- `Autoconfiguration`: Developers can manually configure their Spring application. However when not done, Spring Boot can change the configuration based on the listed dependencies.
For Eg: If "MySQL" is listed in dependencies, & connection configuration classes are not defined, then it will configure your Spring application with the “MySQL connector”.

- `Standalone`: No need to deploy the application to a web server. Simply enter the run command to start the application.

- `Opinionated`: Spring Boot decides itself the defaults to be used for the configuration. Also, it decides which packages to install for the required dependencies.
For Eg: If Spring Boot starter “pom” for “JPA” is listed, it will autoconfigure an in-memory database, a hibernate entity manager, and a simple data source. This opinionated default configuration can be overridden.

**Advantages of Spring Boot:**

- Makes use of Java, which is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- Acts as really good tool for creation & deployment of production-grade applications quickly without worrying about setting up the tricky configurations.
- Helps to autoconfigure all components for a production-grade Spring application.
- Avoids writing lots of boilerplate code, annotations, and XML configuration.
- Comes with embedded HTTP servers like Tomcat or Jetty to test web applications.

**Limitations of Spring Boot:**

- The opinionated style installs many extra dependencies it assumes you’ll need. Due to which the deployment binary size can become very large.
- The Spring Boot artifact can be directly deployed into Docker containers. This is great for quickly creating microservices. However, Since the framework has been built to be agile and lightweight, it should therefore not be used for monolithic applications.
- It's quite a struggle to upgrade legacy spring code to spring boot.

**Spring V/S Spring Boot:**

`Spring Framework`:
- A lightweight & widely-used Java EE framework for building applications.
- Aims to simplify Java EE development which makes developers more productive.
- Primary feature is **Dependency Injection** _(Inversion of Control)_ through which it provides flexibility.
- Simplication is achieved by allowing to develop loosely coupled applications.
- Has support for both XML and annotation configuration.
- A lot of code (boilerplate code) needs to be written for doing the minimal task.
- Does not provide support for an in-memory database.
- For testing the Spring project, server needs to be setup explicitly.
- Developers manually define dependencies for the Spring project in pom.xml file.

`Spring Boot Framework` :
- An integration framework widely used to develop REST APIs.
- Built on top of the Spring framework, and it comes with many dependencies that can be plugged into the Spring application.
- Focuses on shortening the code length & provides easiest way to develop Web Applications.
- Primary feature is **Autoconfiguration**. It automatically configures the classes based on the requirement.
- Helps to create a stand-alone application with less configuration.
- Reduces boilerplate code.
- Provides with an easy way to run the Spring application.
- Offers embedded server such as Jetty and Tomcat, etc for testing the project.
- Offers several plugins for working with an embedded and in-memory database such as H2.
- Comes with the concept of starter in pom.xml file that internally takes care of downloading the dependencies JARs based on the requirement.

**Layers in Spring Boot:**
- Presentation Layer :
    - Handles HTTP Requests
    - Authentication
    - JSON Transactions
    - Front-End Views


- Business Layer :
    - Handles Business Logic
    - Authorization
    - Validation


- Persistence Layer :
    - Handles Storage Logic
    - Translates Business Objects from and to DB Rows


- Database Layer :
    - Actual Database
    - CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations}_


## Annotations

Annotations is a form of metadata that provides data about a program. These are used to provide supplemental information about a program.

**Core Spring Framework Annotations :**

- `@Required`: Applies to the bean setter method. Indicates that the annotated bean must be populated at configuration time with the required property.

```java
    public class Car {  
        private Integer cost;  

        @Required  
        public void setCost(Integer cost) {  
            this.cost = cost;  
        }      
    }  
```

- `@Autowired`: Is used to autowire spring bean on setter methods, instance variable, and constructor.

```java
    @Component  
    public class Customer {
        private Person person;  

        @Autowired  
        public Customer(Person person) {   
            this.person = person;
        }  
    }  
```

- `@Configuration`: Class-level annotation. Used as a source of bean definitions.

- `@ComponentScan`: Used to scan a package for beans. Used with the annotation _@Configuration_

```java
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = "tech.jaykay12")  
    @Configuration  
    public class Car {  
        // ...
    }  
```

- `@Bean`: Method-level annotation. Alternative of XML <bean> tag. Tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by Spring Container.

```java
    @Bean  
    public Car createCarObject() {  
        return new Car();  
    }  
```

**Spring Framework Stereotype Annotations :**

- `@Component`: Class-level annotation. Used to mark a Java class as a bean. The Spring Framework pick it up during Component Scanning and configures it in the application context as a Spring Bean.

```java
    @Component  
    public class ProductDTO {  
    // ...  
    }  
```

- `@Controller`: Class-level annotation. Specialization of _@Component_. Marks a class as a web request handler & is often used to serve web pages.

```java
    @Controller  
    @RequestMapping("products")  
    public class ProductsController {
        @RequestMapping(value = "/{name}", method = RequestMethod.GET)  
        public Product getProductsByName() {  
            return productsDTO;  
        }
        @RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)  
        public Product getProductsById() {  
            return productsDTO;  
        }  
    }  
```

- `@Service`: Class-level annotation. Tells the Spring that class contains the business logic.

```java
    package tech.jaykay12;  
    @Service  
    public class ProductsLogic {
        public void exactMatchProducts() {  
            //business code  
        }  
    }  
```

- `@Repository`: Class-level annotation. The repository is a DAOs (Data Access Object) that access the database directly. The repository does all the DB Operations.

```java
    package tech.jaykay12;  
    @Repository   
    public class DBOperations {
        public void deleteProducts() {     
            //persistence code  
        }  
    }  
```

**Spring Boot Annotations :**

- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Auto-configures the bean that is present in the classpath and configures it to run the methods. Usage reduced now.

- `@SpringBootApplication`: A combination of three annotations _@EnableAutoConfiguration_, _@ComponentScan_, and _@Configuration_.

**Spring MVC and REST Annotations :**

- `@RequestMapping`: Used to map the web requests on the specific handler method. It has many optional elements like consumes, header, method, name, params, path, produces, and value. We use it with the class as well as the method.

    - `@GetMapping`: Used to create a web service endpoint that fetches. Eqivalent to: _@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)_

    - `@PostMapping`: Used to create a web service endpoint that creates. Equivalent to: _@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)_

    - `@PutMapping:` Used to create a web service endpoint that creates or updates. Equivalent to:  _@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)_

    - `@DeleteMapping`: Used to create a web service endpoint that deletes a resource. Equivalent to: _@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)_

    - `@PatchMapping`: Maps the HTTP PATCH requests on the specific handler method. Equivalent to: _@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PATCH)_

- `@ResponseBody`: Binds the method return value to the response body. Tells the Spring Boot Framework to serialize the return object into JSON and XML format.

- `@RestController`: A combination of _@Controller_ & _@ResponseBody_ annotations. It eliminates the need for annotating each method with _@ResponseBody_.

- <ins>**Request Annotations**</ins>

   - `@RequestBody`: Used to bind HTTP request with an object in a method parameter. _HTTP MessageConverters_ is used internally.

   - `@RequestParam`: Used to extract the query parameters from the URL. Most suitable for web applications.

   - `@RequestHeader`: Used to get the details about the HTTP request headers. Used as a method parameter.

   - `@RequestAttribute`: Binds a method parameter to request attribute.

   - `@PathVariable`: Used to extract the values from the URI. It is most suitable for the RESTful web service, where the URL contains a path variable.

## Dependency Management

Spring Boot manages dependencies and configuration automatically. We do not have to specify the version of the dependencies in our configuration. Spring Boot manages them itself. Spring Boot upgrades all dependencies automatically as and when Spring Boot version is upgraded.

`pom.xml` file is used for dependency management.

Spring Boot provides a number of starters that allow us to add jars in the classpath. Spring Boot built-in starters make development easier and rapid. Spring Boot Starters are the dependency descriptors.
Some prominent ones are as follows:

- spring-boot-starter-parent
- spring-boot-starter-web
- spring-boot-starter-batch
- spring-boot-starter-test
- spring-boot-starter-actuator
- spring-boot-starter-jdbc
- spring-boot-starter-websocket
- spring-boot-starter-logging
- spring-boot-starter-log4j2
- spring-boot-starter-tomcat
- spring-boot-starter-jetty
- spring-boot-starter-undertow

#### **Spring Boot Starter Parent**
spring-boot-starter-parent is a project starter. It provides default configurations for the Spring applications. It is used internally by all dependencies. Majority of Spring Boot projects use spring-boot-starter-parent as a parent in pom.xml file.

```xml
    <parent>  
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>  
        <version>1.4.0.RELEASE</version>  
    </parent>  
```

Parent Poms allow us to manage the following things for multiple child projects and modules:
- Configuration (Java versions, plugin configurations etc.)
- Dependency Management

Spring Boot Starter Parent defines spring-boot-dependencies as a parent pom. It inherits dependency management from spring-boot-dependencies.

#### **Spring Boot Starter Web**
There are two important features of spring-boot-starter-web, it is compatible for web development & auto-configurable nature.

```xml
    <dependency>  
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>  
        <version>2.2.2.RELEASE</version>  
    </dependency>
```

Starter of Spring web uses Spring MVC, REST and Tomcat as a default embedded server. The single spring-boot-starter-web dependency transitively pulls in all dependencies related to web development.

For using Jetty or Undertow as embedded server instead of tomcat, modify `pom.xml` as follows:
```xml
    <dependency>  
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>  
        <exclusions>  
            <exclusion>  
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>  
            </exclusion>  
        </exclusions>  
    </dependency>  
    <dependency>  
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>  
    </dependency>  
```

#### **Spring Boot Starter Actuator**
Basically a sub-project of the Spring Boot Framework. It includes a number of additional features that help us to monitor and manage the Spring Boot application. If we want to get production-ready features in an application, we should use the Spring Boot actuator.

3 main features:

- <ins>**Endpoint:**</ins> The actuator endpoints allows us to monitor and interact with the application. Spring Boot provides a number of built-in endpoints. We can also create our own endpoint. We can enable and disable each endpoint individually. For example, the /health endpoint provides the basic health information of an application.

- <ins>**Metrics:**</ins> Spring Boot Actuator provides dimensional metrics by integrating with the micrometer. The micrometer is integrated into Spring Boot. It is the instrumentation library powering the delivery of application metrics from Spring.

- <ins>**Audit:**</ins> Spring Boot provides a flexible audit framework that publishes events to an AuditEventRepository. It automatically publishes the authentication events if spring-security is in execution.

We can enable actuator by injecting the dependency spring-boot-starter-actuator in the pom.xml file.

#### **Spring Boot Starter Test**
The spring-boot-starter-test is the primary dependency for the test. It contains the majority of elements required for our tests.

We have to write different types of tests (unit tests, integration tests, functional tests) for testing & automating the health of application.

```xml
    <dependency>  
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>  
        <version>2.2.2.RELEASE</version>  
        <scope>test</scope>  
    </dependency>  
```

It pulls all the dependencies related to test. After adding it, we can build up a simple unit test.
`<scope>test</scope>`: It means when the application is bundled and packaged for deployment, any dependency that is declared with the test scopes is ignored. The test scope dependencies are only available when running in the development and Maven test modes.

## Spring Boot Packaging

In J2EE application, modules are packed in 3 compressed file formats: JAR, WAR, and EAR.

- **WAR** stands for Web Archive.
     - WAR file represents the web application.
     - Web module contains servlet classes, JSP files, HTML files, JavaScripts, etc. are packaged as a JAR file with .war extension. It contains a special directory called WEB-INF.
     - WAR is a module that loads into a web container of the Java Application Server. The Java Application Server has two containers:
          - The Web Container hosts the web applications based on Servlet API and JSP.
          - An EJB Container hosts Enterprise Java beans based on EJB API.


- **JAR** stands for Java Archive.
     - An EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) module that contains bean files (class files), a manifest, and EJB deployment descriptor (XML file) are packaged as JAR files with the extension .jar.
     - It is used by software developers to distribute Java classes and various metadata.


- **EAR** stands for Enterprise Archive.
     - EAR file represents the enterprise application. The above two files are packaged as a JAR file with the .ear extension.
     - It is deployed into the Application Server. It can contain multiple EJB modules (JAR) and Web modules (WAR).
     - It is a special JAR that contains an application.xml file in the META-INF folder.

Spring Boot Framework comes with a built-in mechanism for application configuration using a file called `application.properties`. It is located inside the src/main/resources folder.       
The properties have default values for Spring application configurations which can be modified. Spring Boot also allows us to define our own property if required. The application.properties file allows us to run an application in a different environment.

Prominent properties are as follows:
- Debug _(false)_
- server.port _(8080)_
- logging.file
- logging.file.path
- spring.config.name _(application)_
- spring.http.multipart.enabled
- spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size
- spring.social.facebook.app-id
- spring.social.linkedin.app-id
